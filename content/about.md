# About me

My name is Mirella van Teulingen and I'm a Dutch front end developer at
[Dreamsolution](http://www.dreamsolution.nl) in Delft, where
I have the privilege to work in a team of experts in python, javascript
and design.

The key areas of experience include HTML, CSS, Django templating. I also
have experience with XML, XSLT, [Plone](http://www.plone.org) and
Zope Page Templates (templating used in Plone). The last few years I'm
extending my knowledge with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/),
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/), jQuery and javascript.

Detailed information about my working experience can be found on
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mirellavanteulingen).

## Fronteers

Since 2012 am I a member of [Fronteers](http://www.fronteers.nl),
a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers.
Since the end of 2013 I'm a volunteer at the workshops committee. We
organise [workshops](https://fronteers.nl/workshops) about
front end techniques, which everyone can attend for a small fee.

## Personal life

In my personal life I'm living together with my boyfriend and my 2
British Shorthair cats, Tolstoj and Frummel in Wateringen, a small village
near The Hague and Delft. When I'm not working, reading professional
literature or fiddling in code I can often be found down the gym.
To compensate being between 4 walls all day, I mostly go by bike to work.
It is a nice bike ride of 10km through the typical Dutch landscape.
My interests also include reading common history, sci-fi, fantasy and thrillers.
