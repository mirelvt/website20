# About me

My name is Mirella van Teulingen and I'm a Dutch front end developer at
[Dreamsolution](http://www.dreamsolution.nl) in Delft, where
I have the privilege to work in a team of experts in python, javascript
and design.

The key areas of experience include HTML, CSS, Sass, jQuery, DOM scripting and Django templating.
I also have experience with XML, XSLT, [Plone](http://www.plone.org) and
Zope Page Templates (templating language used in Plone).

Detailed information about my working experience can be found on
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mirellavanteulingen).

## Fronteers

Since 2012 am I a member of [Fronteers](http://www.fronteers.nl),
a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers.
From 2013 till 2015, I volunteered the workshops committee. This committee
organises [workshops](https://fronteers.nl/workshops) about
front end techniques, which everyone can attend for a small fee.

## Personal life

I live with my husband and my 2 British Shorthair cats, Tolstoj and Frummel in Wateringen,
a small village near The Hague and Delft. When I'm not working, reading professional
literature or fiddling in code I can often be found down the gym or on my motorcycle (Kawasaki er6f).
To compensate being between 4 walls all day, I mostly go by bike to work.
It is a nice bike ride of 10km through the typical Dutch landscape.
My interests also include reading common history, sci-fi, fantasy and thrillers.
