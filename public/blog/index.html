    <div class="blog-date">November 21, 2015</div>
    In 2013 and 2014 I used Icomoon to create font icons. It is a nice library and tool. You can choose icons from their library and they have the feature to upload your own svgs to create the font icon set. It is a great tool if you only need to generate the font icon once. But not when you have to add new ones to the set.

    <div class="blog-date">July 3, 2015</div>
    In May, Roy Tomeij wrote the article &#39;Configurable star rating without JS&#39;. I was thinking how to do this using a font icon instead of a background image and make the stars clickable. I believe it would take less code to write, and it is.

    At Dreamsolution we regularly use Crispy Forms to generate  complex forms in Django. I want to share some practical customization examples with Crispy Forms using the formhelper API.

    <h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/customize_sublime/" class="title">Customize Sublime text editor</a></h2>
    <div class="blog-date">February 12, 2014</div>
    At the Fronteers conference 2012 in Amsterdam, Addy Osmani used Sublime Text Editor in his presentation. The editor looked really interesting. Right after the conference I installed Sublime and looked around for packages which would make my life as front end developer easier and make editing more fun. This article is a small tutorial with tips to configure Sublime to your needs, a list of interesting packages, how to customize a theme and links to useful documentation.

    <div class="blog-date">June 16, 2013</div>
    Friday 14 june in Amsterdam I attended the CSSDay conference. Eight experts talked about 8 different CSS modules. The focus was on techniques of these modules we might not know about and the future of CSS. During the conference I learned that CSS is in very active development. It was an incredible, informative and awesome day. An high standard conference I&#39;ve ever attended so far. I hope that there will be another one within 1 or 2 years.
