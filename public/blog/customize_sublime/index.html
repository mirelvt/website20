  <h1>Customize Sublime text editor</h1>
  <p>
    12-02-2014 <br>
    Last year at the Fronteers conference in Amsterdam, Addy Osmani used Sublime Text Editor in his presentation.
    The editor looked really cool. Right after the conference I installed Sublime and looked around for
    packages which would make my life as front end developer easier and make editing more fun. After a
    month of playing with Sublime, I decided to leave TextMate (used it since 2005) and use Sublime as
    my new main editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this article I'll give you tips to configure Sublime to your needs, interesting packages,
    how to customize a theme and links to useful documentation. Let's get started.
  </p>
  <h2>Install Sublime Text Editor and packages</h2>
   <p>The official page of Sublime Text Editor is:
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">http://www.sublimetext.com</a>,
      you can find the downloads for OS X, Windows and Linux on:
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">http://www.sublimetext.com/2</a>.
      To make the most out of Sublime, the first package you want to install
      is the <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">
      Package Control Manager</a>. With this tool you can easily install
      useful packages. Follow the installation described on:
      <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation">
        http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation</a>.
        The installation is really easy.
    </p>
    <p>When the Package Control is installed, you can start installing
      packages you would like to use. Open Sublime and type in the following
      command:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>P</strong>
        to open the Packages directory.</li>
      <li>Type "<strong>install</strong>" and click on the search result:
        <strong>"Package Control: Install Package"</strong>.
        In this window you can search for the packages you like to install.
      </li>
    </ul>

     <p>
      I made a list of packages what makes programming more fun and my life as
      front end developer easier:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sass</strong>: syntax highlighting and tab/code completion
        for Sass.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements">
          <strong>Sidebar enhancement</strong></a>: With this plugin you can
          do the basics via the sidebar, like new file/folder, edit,
          open/run, reveal, find in selected/parent/project, etc.</li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://emmet.io">Emmet</a></strong>: looks like a
        really awesome toolkit to improve your HTML &amp; CSS workflow.
        Check out the <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">documentation</a>
        to see what it can do for you. I just read their documentation and
        installed it. I don't have  experience with it yet, but it looks
        really promising.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Less-Build</strong>: if you work with
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> I recommend to use this tool.
        It provides two build systems for '.less' files, both minified and
        non-minified. Requires lessc (via node.js) on OSX and Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <a href="git://github.com/danro/LESS-sublime.git">LESS</a>
        </strong>: syntax highlighting for LESS.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <a href="https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro">Djaneiro</a>
        </strong>: syntax highlighting and code completion for Django.
      </li>
      <li><strong>HTML5</strong></li>
      <li><strong>HTML Snippets</strong></li>
      <li><strong>HTML Attributes</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/SublimeHg">SublimeHG</a>
        </strong>: is a nice tool for
        <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>. I use it to
        see which files are changed, to write commit messages and pushing
        it to the repository.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you don't work with LESS or Sass than you could use the following
      tools to create css prefixes and to minify your css/js:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/prefixr">Prefixr</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/bistory/Sublime-Minifier">Minifier</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sublime customization</h2>
    <p>You can customize Sublime to your needs, like translating tab size to
      spaces, font size, line highlight etc. These customizations are stored
      in the user settings:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"Preferences &gt; Settings-user"</strong> (on Linux), or
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>"Sublime Text 2 &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings-user"</strong>
            (on OS X).
          </li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    Here's a list of useful settings. You can check the default_settings for
    the complete list you wish to override.
    <pre class="language-json" rel="json"><code><span class="punctuation">{</span>
<span class="code-indent string">"font_size":</span> <span class="number">11</span>,
<span class="code-indent string">"bold_folder_labels":</span><span class="boolean">true</span>,
<span class="code-indent string">"caret_style":</span> "phase", <span class="comment">// it will fade in and out rather than blink.</span>
<span class="code-indent string">"highlight_line":</span> <span class="boolean">true</span>,
<span class="code-indent string">"ignored_packages":</span>
<span class="code-indent token">[</span>
<span class="code-indent-2 string">"Vintage"</span>
<span class="code-indent token">]</span><span class="string">,</span>
<span class="code-indent string">"match_tags":</span> <span class="boolean">true</span>,
<span class="code-indent comment">// scroll_past_end is already set in default settings,</span>
<span class="code-indent comment">// but on OS X, this value is overridden in the platform specific settings.</span>
<span class="code-indent comment">// That's why you need to place this line in your user settings.</span>
<span class="code-indent string">"scroll_past_end":</span> <span class="boolean">true</span>,
<span class="code-indent string">"translate_tabs_to_spaces":</span><span class="boolean">true</span>,
<span class="code-indent string">"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save":</span> <span class="boolean">true</span>
<span class="punctuation">}</span></code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Sublime Key commands</h2>

    <p>Sublime has a lot of cool and very handy key commands. The ones I use most are (on OS X):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Opening The Packages directory</strong>: use the command <strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>P</strong>. All resources for supported programming and markup languages are stored here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Opening a file:</strong> <strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>P</strong>. Start typing the name of the file and you get a list of matched file names.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Opening a file and search for a string</strong>: Use the command <strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>P</strong> and type [filename]@[string], for example: main@wrapper. It will open the file with the name <em>"main"</em> with a string <em>"wrapper"</em> in it. In my case the <em>".wrapper"</em> class is in the <em>"main.scss"</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple selection: you will never use <em>"find and replace"</em> again. To add all occurrences of the current word to the selection, use <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>G</strong> on OS X, or <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>F3</strong> on Windows and Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Split windows</strong>: you can split your window in multiple edit screens. To do so use the key commands <strong>cmd</strong>+<strong>alt</strong>+<strong>2</strong>, this split the window in 2 panels. It depends on the width of your screen how many split windows are useful to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emmet key commands</strong>: I tried some key commands shown on the demo site, but some of them didn't work, like creating a data uri. Most of these key commands are only for the demo. I found a list of working commands on: <a href="https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#available-actions">github</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete list of <strong>Sublime commands</strong>: check out the page on  <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html">http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <figcaption>Find file with class name in Sublime.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Open files via the terminal</h2>
    <p>
      I mostly use the terminal to navigate to folders and to open it in sublime. To use an easy command for it I created a symbolic link. In OS X the Application is in "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl". If it is in another directory use that path in step 2. Open your terminal and type in the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre class="language-terminal" rel="Terminal"><code>$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ ln -s /Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl sublime</code>
    </pre>
    <p>That's it. You can now use the command <em>"sublime"</em> in your terminal.</p>
    <h2>Find your theme</h2>
    <p>
      Sublime comes with a couple of standard themes. If none of the default themes matches your personal color styles, you can find a lot of other themes on the internet. I use the Github version from <a href="https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes">Dayle Rees Color Schemes</a> and made some changes in it. How did I do that?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I installed <em>"Dayle Rees color schemes"</em> via Package manager.</li>
      <li>Then I opened the folder <em>Browse Packages</em> (via Preferences).</li>
      <li>Find the theme package and copy the theme file to your user directory in Browser Packages. In my case it was <em>"Github.tmTheme"</em>. This is an XML file.</li>
      <li>Rename the copied file.</li>
      <li>Select your theme via <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Color Scheme</strong> &gt; <strong>User</strong>.</li>
      <li>Open the file in Sublime and play with the colors you want to change. I opened a CSS and HTML File side by side to see the effect of my changes.</li>
      <li>When you're done, you can just close the theme file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope this article is meaningful for the people who want to start using Sublime. You can evaluate Sublime for free, and when you are enthusiastic about it, a personal license is only $70.</p>
