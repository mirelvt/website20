            <p>"Responsive design is the red pill from the Matrix. We've been living in a conceptual hallucination of control. While 'pixel perfect' is the blue pill." In the early years we used DTP for setting up the boundaries of Web pages. It is something we knew how it works, something we hold on to. We didn't really know how to handle the internet. Fixed width and height and it should look exact the same as the print. "Reality simply doesn't work that way."</p><p>The media is in all sizes. Big wide monitors, smartphones, tablets, internet via television. There are numbers of screen resolutions out there. It is all fluid. And most important, web page is about content. Web design is about creating solutions how to serve the content on all these devices.</p><p>So we go for responsive design: layout that resizes and where content is reordered to fit different screen resolutions. As Mark Boulton has put it: "Responsive design is for us like tumbling down the rabbit hole. Because how do we do responsive design?"</p><h2>Responsive design challenges</h2><p>It challenge Business:</p><ul><li>It costs more, according to a Disney survey.</li><li>The costs lies with the agency doing the work.</li><li>People don't want to pay for it.</li><li>So you charge more.</li></ul><p>If you use the waterfall approach for responsive design, you'll find out it is too time and money consuming:</p><ul><li>The designer creates a beautiful design in Photoshop (or other design software) for different screen resolutions, the client accepts it or want to have some tweaks.</li><li>When the design is finished it goes to the front end developer and or programmer. They build it and the website is placed on the server, ready for the content.</li><li>The content editor sees the site for the first time and start filling it with content.</li><li>Site is ready for launch.</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #1</strong><br>Problem of this approach is how many screen resolutions must the designer take into account in his design mock up? 3 types, like desktop (1024x 786), 1 tablet (600x 800), 1 smartphone: 320 x 480? or 8?</p><p><strong>Problem #2</strong><br>How many pages must be presented in these mock ups? Homepage? Product page?</p><p><strong>Problem #3</strong><br>It cannot be pixel perfect. What you see in the mock up can hardly be implemented the exact same way on all screen resolutions, or browsers.</p><p><strong>Problem #4</strong><br>In many cases the content editor has only seen some mock ups and start fill in content when the site is ready. However when the editor starts writing the content he can run into some boundaries of the layout/functionality of the site. In that case the editor can do 2 things: either has to change the content so it fits the design or go back to the designer + development team to let them come with a solution that fits the content.</p><h2>Responsive design challenge Advertising:</h2><p>"Advertising has been ruining the design of content web sites for 20 years." - Peter-Paul Koch. "Advertisments are really tied to certain sizes. Technically it would be trivial to develop something that would serve different ads at different breakpoints. The advertising model is still selling areas with ads like 50 years ago. In responsive there are no fixed areas."</p><p><strong>How do we deal with this in responsive designs?</strong></p><p>Advertising don't want to change. We shouldn't try to. Just try to make them come to you.</p><h2>Responsive design challenges content:</h2><p>Stories have a collections of little pieces of content attached (video, quotes, images, text, etc) The story is no longer a page but a content editor still thinks this way.</p><p>"a page" doesn't exist anymore in responsive design. It's about chunks of content put together in a smart way.</p><p><em><strong>Responsive design forces you to focus on the content!</strong></em></p><p>NASA's job is to inspire a generation. How do you make content more interesting? Try to find anything that would appeal to your mom ;) Create a comphrension matrix on what people might understand (scientists want data not pretty pictures, general public wants the exact opposite). Mark Boulton also talks about work at Cern. If it takes 6 months to generate a homepage image. Do it! People want to see it!</p><p>Not every screen has to show all content: watch Karen McGrane's video about: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGyBrlCKySk">"Adapting to Adaptive Content"</a> So how should we handle Responsive design? Main point is responsive design affects:</p><ul><li>build process,</li><li>way of working in teams, content and design.</li></ul><p>Mark Boultons advice is to let the departments work more closely together. Don't stay on your island.</p><p>A cheap and easy way to work is using pen and paper to create sketches. Some of the customers will freak out, because they expect a fancy design. But in the long run clients will go like "WOW, this works on all devices".</p><p>He also says that prototyping is the best way. [Personal note to myself: I couldn't really figure out in the presentation why he believes this is the best way to do responsive design development. But it is something worth to check out.]</p><h2>And what about CMS?</h2><p>How can we change CMS to make it more natural to work with/display content? CMS need to be more aligned to responsive design principles and let writers be able to structure their content.</p><p>Make your content (text, images etc) reusable instead of just thinking in fixed pages. This is hard, but absolutely neccesary for responsive to work!</p><p>Further more we need better tools to support the editorial process. Content management is not a technical problem, but a people/process problem.</p>
