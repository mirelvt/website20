            <p>David DeSandro talked about his personal open source project and shared his experience, problems and solutions he run into when he shared his project with the world. The main subject of this presentation is how you can make money from open source projects. To get paid for the work you share with others.</p><p>If you want to do side projects you have to work on something that excites you. It is also a way to market yourself and to build and promote your personal brand. The community gets another tool for its toolkit. And most of these tools are free.</p><h2>The culture of free</h2><p>The culture of free, has the following components:</p><ul><li>you can view the source</li><li>there is no paywall</li><li>costs no money to...</li><li>you can learn for free</li><li>use the resources</li><li>and market your stuff</li></ul><p>It is the ideal environment to be creative.</p><p>It feels good to share your code with the world and you like it when others start using it. But there is a downside. People who use your code, they expect that you solve their problems to get your code working. For them it take 5 minutes to send the mail with a support question, but for you it take at least 30 minutes to help them. For David, these support questions were piling up.</p><h2>How do you deal with it?</h2><p>David asked himself "Why don't I put a price on my product?" Users have to make a value judgement, how much money is it worth for me.</p><p>There are people who are making a money: like the app store, WP premium themes. Is there a market for front-end development resources?</p><p>FancyZoom was one of the first pioneers in this field. For $39 you could get a commercial license. David made Isotope as a commercial fill-in plug-in for Masonry with the FancyZoom model.</p><p>David didn't like the available options:</p><ul><li>adopt fancyzoom license model.</li><li>still open source = on github.</li><li>github donation</li><li>Flattr</li><li>Generic PayPal donation, but not happy with those donation options.</li></ul><p>And started a company next to his agency for his side projects.</p><p>It feels kind a bit against the open source thought, but the results are incredible:</p><ul><li>Sold <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">Isotope</a> for $37 / License (now $25), responsible for 25% of income in 2011.</li><li>Able to pay off car loan and student loan.</li><li>Impact on quality of life.</li><li>At a cost of 20% of my free time.</li><li>Also the price allows non technical users to contribute to the product.</li></ul><p>Are support emails bugging you? Think about it. If so, ask support fee.</p><p>There is a huge market for commercial front-end dev resources. Free<xsl:text>&amp;</xsl:text>open source ideal doesn't scale. It is OK to make money out of honest work.</p>
