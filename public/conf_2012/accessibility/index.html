                <h1>Accessibility on the web</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">
                     - Antoine Hegeman, Bor Verkroost, Bram Duvigneau&amp;Chris Heilmann 
                    
                    
                        - Video: <a href="http://vimeo.com/52882798">http://vimeo.com/52882798</a>
                    
                </p>
                <p>What is the best way to talk about accessibility? To invite people with a disability who wants to share how they experience the web. Instead of someone telling us what people with a disability need. I really find this the best way to learn how we can change things for the better. I liked the examples they gave as well. You see and understand their frustration when something isn't working on the web.</p><h2>Bor Verkroost</h2><p>Bor is the founder and owner of 1-UP and 1-UP Consultancy. From birth, Bor has suffered from Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. A very rare and complex disease, leading to scarring and extreme vulnerability of the skin. Also, it immobilizes and causes the fingers to be severely contracted.</p><p>He showd us 3 issues we should be aware of:</p><ul><li>Touch related devices won't work for people with a hand disability.</li><li>Drop down menu's with no delay are a pain.</li><li>Little space between navigation items are also troublesome.</li></ul><p>Bor explains that every touch related device won't work for people with a hand disability. He for instance works with a mouse and uses the search function to scroll. Scrolling 1 page designs are an issue for him.</p><p>He also explains that when having a drop down menu, add a delay to the hover, so that the menu does not disappear the moment you move the mouse cursor from the menu. People have a hard time to focus their cursor on the right spot. This also means that enough space between navigation items is also valuable to them.</p><h2>Bram Duvigneau</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;Simplifying user interface will help in accessibility.&rdquo; - Bram Duvigneau</blockquote><p>Bram is a freelance software developer and accessibility consultant. Being blind from birth, he has a very practical vision on web accessibility.</p><p>Bram showed Google search as an example: The voice over first goes through all the links which are placed in the top of the site, then the logo, search button etc. Before you finally get to the search results. When you have to rely on a voice over than it is very irritating when you have to go through non valuable information first, before you reach the section what worth hearing/reading.</p><p>Bram also says that key controls are a problem too. Because as developer you can assign a key or combination to do something on the site. But how does a visitor knows which key is for what? This could be simpler, like using hot keys.</p><p>iPhone has an easy way to start the speaker and is more user friendly. Bram also explains that reading services are actually annoying for blind people. The reading option on a website is useless, because a blind person has his own software. Another thing I didn't know (because I don't work with Flash),is that Flash is not visible for VoiceOver on Mac, it is only useful with a screen reader on Windows. But the Narrator on Windows is useless until Windows 8.</p><h2>Another few examples</h2><p>One of the biggest annoyances are web applications that switch single click to double click. This differs from common usability rules.</p><p>Antoine Hegeman gave a good example of UWV website. The online form is accessible, but to finish it, you have to print, sign and mail it the old fashion way. To fix this UWV could start to use DigiD, but why don't they?</p><p>Splash pages (example www.nettorama.nl) is pretty awful too. Every click is a lot of work for someone with cerebral palsy.</p>
