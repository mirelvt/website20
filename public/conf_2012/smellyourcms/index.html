                        - Video: <a href="http://vimeo.com/53317254">http://vimeo.com/53317254</a>

                <p>Phil works as a web developer in London for R/GA. His presentation is to ask yourself and or your customer: do you really need a CMS? He also talks about the role of the web builder (agency) and the customer. It was a great and funny presentation. It really gave me energy and stuff to think about.</p><h2>The CMS Paradox</h2><p>Usually we give clients what they want, they want a system that is scalable and has lots of features. But the system which has to answer to these demands becomes very complex in the backbone but also for the user. Having a lot of features doesn't mean it is user friendly.</p><p>In the end the customer gets a system which can do a lot but the customer actually use only 20% of it.</p><p>We should actually give what the customer really needs.</p><p>The responsibility of the agency/developer is:</p><ul><li>To learn by example: view the source.</li><li>Craft of code: to move forward as developers and agencies, respect the craft of code.</li></ul><p>Example Grolsch.com has a 30MB homepage, just like Beetle.com with lots of scrolling effects.</p><p>The CMS paradox is more obvious in large organisations. If you paid a fortune, then you'll sure it's a good system!</p><p>The CMS paradox is:</p><ul><li>It doesn't really solve problems.</li><li>it is enterprise level</li><li>expensive</li><li>flexibility doesn't really give flexibility! It doesn't always end up in flexible solutions.</li><li>Because you have so much choices -&gt; paralysis</li><li>cost of system proportional to cost of changes: People need to get trained, the ability to make changes has a cost associated with it.</li><li>Most content managers are ending up as a developer.</li></ul><p>It has a powerful workflow. But does the shit get done?</p><p>People at the top like the idea of a controlling system, but the CMS is being used by an intern or a developer in the end, not the CEO. People tend to subvert the system because of all the security and controlling workflows.</p><h2>Code smell</h2><p><strong>CMS's don't just leave a smell, they actually stink!</strong><br>Browse on the internet and just look at the url or code and you know that you're dealing with a CMS. Most CMS's expose the technology in URLs, such as an url ending in .php or .asp. This is a type of lock in. For example:<br><a href="http://eur.burton.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Burton_EU-Site/default">http://eur.burton.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Burton_EU-Site/default</a> That's not a cool URL :)<br>Or stinky code: <a href="http://www.episerver.com/">http://www.episerver.com/</a> pages has lots of crap in the HTML, like a hidden<xsl:text>&lt;form&gt;</xsl:text>tag around everything that includes a hash of the view state.</p><p>URL design is a craft and should be part of the CMS when developing a website.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Challenge CMS stink. Fight for the chance to do good on the web.&rdquo; <cite>- Phil Hawksworth</cite></blockquote><p>Optimisation:</p><ul><li>To serve a good performing web page you want a good base (not a CMS).</li><li>Building a site with modules kills performance and leads to a maintenance nightmare and makes Steve Souders cry.</li></ul><p>Modularity<xsl:text>&amp;</xsl:text>flexibility (o really?): With all those modules you end up in a soup, maintenance is a nightmare. And kills performance.</p><h2>CMS: the power to ruin their site (Rachel Andrew)</h2><p>Core feature: WYSIWIG = Danger. It ruins the layout of the site. We should protect the design experience. We should protect the markup.</p><p>WYSYWIG can fuck up designs pretty often, and it's really hard to do it properly. Instead of WYSIWYG use Markdown. With Markdown you manage the content not the design. In that way, constrains can be enablers. When we are able to get the user to manage content and not design, it will keep the site future friendly and maintainable.</p><h2>CMS enhancements</h2><ul><li>Challenge the introduction of stink, simplify the implementation of the system. Build CMS more future friendly, like mobile support.</li><li>Challenge the customer by asking what content REALLY needs to be dynamic. Think about it.</li></ul><h2>Consider NOCMS</h2><p>You can use for instance <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> it uses ruby to spit out static html. Or <a href="http://grabaperch.com">Perch CMS</a>, which focuses on the front end, generating the admin part from the tagged front end design. Combine your website with <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> to speed it up.</p>
